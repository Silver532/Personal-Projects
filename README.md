Hello World!

This is a Repo of my personal projects. Incomplete projects may be completed at some point,
but that is not the point of this repo

These projects were created over the course of a year and a half as a way to learn python, 
and you can definitely see it in the code quality.

There are multiple projects in here where I intentionally did things in a strange way.
This could be for multiple reasons, such as seeing a feature and building a program around it,
or because I was trying to optimize for something like line count as a challenge.

I will not be updating any completed projects, as this repo is to show my improvement,
not to have everything work perfectly.

Thanks - Silver532
